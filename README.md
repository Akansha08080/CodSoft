CodSoft Internship Projects ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains my projects from a one-month internship in data science. The tasks cover various aspects of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. The projects included are:

1. Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. 
The dataset typically contains information about individual passengers, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Survival status

2. Movie Rating Prediction ðŸŽ¬
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
This project enables you to explore:
- Data analysis
- Preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling techniques
- 
3. Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.
The objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. The dataset includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
